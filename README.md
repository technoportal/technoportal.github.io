# General Introduction

TechnoPortal, accessible at <https://technoportal.hevs.ch/>, is a web portal of ontologies and vocabularies dedicated to the technology sciences domain. It provides a web application as well as an application programming interface (API) and a SPARQL endpoint. It relies on the generic and open technology OntoPortal (<https://ontoportal.org>). The ontology repository allows hosting, searching, versioning, visualization, exploration, commenting and proposing on ontologies; it also includes a semantic annotation service for text (Annotator) and an ontology recommendation service (Recommender) as well as a catalog of alignments between ontologies (Mapping). All within an infrastructure fully compatible with the semantic web.

Any use of the Technoportal web application, or its API, is subject to compliance with these Terms and Conditions (T&C).


## Definitions

**TechnoPortal:** The entire software – consisting of the web application and the programmatic interface – which offers services and functionalities for a defined set of ontologies and other semantic resources, mainly in the technology sciences domain.

**Content:** All data and information contained, hosted and served by TechnoPortal. This mainly concerns the ontologies themselves (source files) and their metadata (catalogue records) but it also includes alignments between ontologies, projects, comments and proposals or any other form of aggregation of this content.

**Ontology:** Term used to cover all types of semantic resources or semantic artefacts hosted and served on TechnoPortal: vocabulary, terminology, thesaurus, taxonomy, etc.

**Web application:** All web pages consumed on the client side and produced by the TechnoPortal software on the server side, to carry out the services that the portal offers and implements. This concerns all web pages accessible from the address:  <https://technoportal.hevs.ch/>

**Programmatic interface (API):** All TechnoPortal functionalities and services accessible via a structured and clearly specified interface allowing a computer program to automatically interact with the software. This concerns all web service calls invoked from the addresses:  <https://technoportal.hevs.ch/> and <https://data.technoportal.hevs.ch/>

**User:** Any natural or legal person who accesses the TechnoPortal ontology repository, directly or via a computer program, in order to consult, contribute or download content for reuse, including for purposes other than those for which this content was produced.

**Contributor:** Any user, natural or legal person, who has a “user account” on TechnoPortal and is authorized to submit and document an ontology or any other form of content. A contributor can, for example, enter comments and proposals related to an ontology or its content. A contributor can be an “ontology administrator” if he/she has deposited it or if he/she has been granted this right.

**Curator:** Any contributor, natural or legal person, who ensures the curation of TechnoPortal content by carrying out verification and harmonization of metadata and all other actions ensuring the quality of TechnoPortal data. A curator can propose modifications to contributors to improve the quality of the ontologies or their metadata, in compliance with the Charter of metadata curators. Any curator has administrative rights over all ontologies in the repository.

**Administrator:** Any curator, natural or legal person, who, in addition to content curation, ensures the general administration of the portal: user management, addition/deletion of content, monitoring of the portal and development of additional functionalities.

**Administrative authority:** Any public or private person responsible for a public service mission.

**Reuse:** Use by any natural or legal person of TechnoPortal ontologies or other content including for purposes other than those for which they were produced.
