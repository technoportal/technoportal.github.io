# Terms & Conditions
## General Introduction

TechnoPortal, accessible at <https://technoportal.hevs.ch/>, is a web portal of ontologies and vocabularies dedicated to the technology sciences domain. It provides a web application as well as an application programming interface (API) and a SPARQL endpoint. It relies on the generic and open technology OntoPortal (<https://ontoportal.org>). The ontology repository allows hosting, searching, versioning, visualization, exploration, commenting and proposing on ontologies; it also includes a semantic annotation service for text (Annotator) and an ontology recommendation service (Recommender) as well as a catalog of alignments between ontologies (Mapping). All within an infrastructure fully compatible with the semantic web.

Any use of the Technoportal web application, or its API, is subject to compliance with these Terms and Conditions (T&C).


### Definitions

**TechnoPortal:** The entire software – consisting of the web application and the programmatic interface – which offers services and functionalities for a defined set of ontologies and other semantic resources, mainly in the technology sciences domain.

**Content:** All data and information contained, hosted and served by TechnoPortal. This mainly concerns the ontologies themselves (source files) and their metadata (catalogue records) but it also includes alignments between ontologies, projects, comments and proposals or any other form of aggregation of this content.

**Ontology:** Term used to cover all types of semantic resources or semantic artefacts hosted and served on TechnoPortal: vocabulary, terminology, thesaurus, taxonomy, etc.

**Web application:** All web pages consumed on the client side and produced by the TechnoPortal software on the server side, to carry out the services that the portal offers and implements. This concerns all web pages accessible from the address:  <https://technoportal.hevs.ch/>

**Programmatic interface (API):** All TechnoPortal functionalities and services accessible via a structured and clearly specified interface allowing a computer program to automatically interact with the software. This concerns all web service calls invoked from the addresses:  <https://technoportal.hevs.ch/> and <https://data.technoportal.hevs.ch/>

**User:** Any natural or legal person who accesses the TechnoPortal ontology repository, directly or via a computer program, in order to consult, contribute or download content for reuse, including for purposes other than those for which this content was produced.

**Contributor:** Any user, natural or legal person, who has a “user account” on TechnoPortal and is authorized to submit and document an ontology or any other form of content. A contributor can, for example, enter comments and proposals related to an ontology or its content. A contributor can be an “ontology administrator” if he/she has deposited it or if he/she has been granted this right.

**Curator:** Any contributor, natural or legal person, who ensures the curation of TechnoPortal content by carrying out verification and harmonization of metadata and all other actions ensuring the quality of TechnoPortal data. A curator can propose modifications to contributors to improve the quality of the ontologies or their metadata, in compliance with the Charter of metadata curators. Any curator has administrative rights over all ontologies in the repository.

**Administrator:** Any curator, natural or legal person, who, in addition to content curation, ensures the general administration of the portal: user management, addition/deletion of content, monitoring of the portal and development of additional functionalities.

**Administrative authority:** Any public or private person responsible for a public service mission.

**Reuse:** Use by any natural or legal person of TechnoPortal ontologies or other content including for purposes other than those for which they were produced.


## Access rights

Using TechnoPortal is free.

TechnoPortal content is by default publicly accessible and open to any user. For ontologies and their metadata, there are nevertheless three levels of access rights:

 - Public access with download of the source file (and versions) possible. The default mode.

 - Public access without downloading the source file. This mode must be explicitly requested to an administrator.

 - Private access reserved for a selection of contributors declared by the depositary of an ontology as well as curators and administrators. This access therefore requires a connection via a user account.


## Purpose and Functionalities

The TechnoPortal ontology repository mainly allows:

 - the discovery, browsing, search, viewing or downloading of ontologies and other content by users;

 - the publication of ontologies or other content by contributors;

 - management of content and the repository by curators and administrators.


### Discovery, consultation, search, viewing or downloading of ontologies and other content by users

TechnoPortal provides ontologies published by contributors which can be accessed for download, or via the web application or the API. 

Consultation of the ontologies and metadata made available for public access on TechnoPortal or their downloading does not require any connection or prior registration by users. Consulting and downloading private ontologies requires authentication. Not creating a user account does not affect consultation of publicly accessible resources on the repository. All users are required to respect the user license specific to each ontology.

Any user can participate in the quality control of TechnoPortal by reporting, to the contact email address, in particular content not intended to appear there (illicit or contrary to the T&Cs).

### Publication of ontologies or other content by contributors

Any contributor can contribute to TechnoPortal content, among other things, by publishing ontologies and documenting them with metadata. Any contributor can also modify or update content to which he or she has the rights (i.e., generally content previously posted). Removing content generally requires contacting an administrator.

To become a contributor, a user must register on TechnoPortal by creating a personal account. For more details on user accounts, see the Privacy section of the T&Cs. After automatic account validation, the various features are immediately available. Administration rights to ontologies other than those deposited by a contributor must be assigned by another contributor who is an administrator of the ontology concerned or by an TechnoPortal curator.


### Content and repository management by curators and administrators

Curators and administrators are associated users or members of the TechnoPortal management and maintenance team. They are responsible as much as possible for controlling the quality and consistency of the repository’s content. The role of curator or administrator must be assigned by another curator or administrator from the management team.
